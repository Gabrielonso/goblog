# goblog
goblog is an application that allows only registered users access to make and see all of their current and previous posts as far as they are logged into their account. It also gives unregistered members the option to register/create new account. When the registeration form is being submitted, all inputs are being validated. If the validation is successfull, all input datas will then be stored in a database and users will get a notification confirming registeration success. Otherwise no data will be sent to the database, users will remain on the form page and texts will show up below fields where the inputs did not meet the validation requirement for that field. This repository contains all files used in developing the micro-blog including that of MeekroDB, a PHP MYSQL library used in accessing the database.
